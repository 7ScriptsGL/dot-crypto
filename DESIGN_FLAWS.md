# .crypto Design Flaws



## Solvable only by redeploying the registry


### Shared resolver records are not reset on transfer

### Shared resolver records are not reset on resolver assignment

### Registry#Transfer event doesn't identify if resolver was reset for the domain

Transfer event identifies the owner being change for the domain, however it doesn't identify if the resolver was also set to `0x00` or it was just the owner change.


## Solvable without redeploying the registry


### Custom records can not be mirrored

When resolver notifies registry about record being set via Registry#sync, it encodes the key using one way encryption.

### Resolver setPreset is not synced with registry


Can be solved by enabling `Registry#sync` call with some special `key` name (e.g. `_`) identying that all of the resolver records were reset for the domain

### Resolver need reconfigure and reconfigureFor methods

This methods would combine calls to #reset+#setMany which should simplify some end user flows requiring 1 signature and 1 tx instead of 2.
